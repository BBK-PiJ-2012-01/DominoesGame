Team project between Sam Wright, Tom Nealon and Hisham Khalifa.

To compile, you'll need JavaFX in your java path.  Unfortunately this isn't the default (but will be in Java 8).  To fix
this, run:
    mvn com.zenjava:javafx-maven-plugin:1.2:fix-classpath
with privileges sufficient for creating files in the Java distribution.

You'll need jdk1.7.0_17 (there's a bug on earlier versions of Java 7 which will cause the application to crash) and
maven.

To run, go to the project directory (which contains the pom.xml file) and run:
    mvn jfx:run
